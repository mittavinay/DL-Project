# DL-Project
Sorghum Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning.

In our Code directory we have Binary Detection for Sorghum Model.ipynb with all neccesary code to implement.
The Data folder has all our train and test data of grey scale images. These grey scale images are pulled in code while loading and further used in implementation.
