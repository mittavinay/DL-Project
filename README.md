Sorghum Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning.
Food production through agriculture has a long
history. Throughout the world, it is a crucial source of income for
people. Without food, no one can survive in our planet. Animals
that depend on plants for food, oxygen, and other necessities
are likewise dependent on them, making plants essential not
just for people. To increase food production, the government
and specialists are making substantial efforts, and these efforts
are showing results in the actual world. All living things in
the ecosystem are impacted in some manner when a plant
contracts a disease. Any part of the plant, including the leaf,
stems amd the branches might be impacted by this disease. Even
different bacterial and fungal infections that affect plants can
have different effects. The goal of this project is to re-develop a
new model of sorghum leaf disease detection to boost the testing
score. Our main motive is to build new models considering the
base models like LeNet-5 and ResNet50 for binary detection on
the dataset. As seen in the previous model is failing to achieve
good accuracy due to multi class classification. So, we decided to
consider a binary classification model approach

In our Code directory we have Binary Detection for Sorghum Model.ipynb with all neccesary code to implement.
The Data folder has all our train and test data of grey scale images. These grey scale images are pulled in code while loading and further used in implementation.
